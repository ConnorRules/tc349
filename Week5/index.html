  <h1> Cardsort Nasa </h1>

	<p> The order I put the cards in followed similarly along with the order of the website. The only major difference was
	that any news article with a person's name in the title was also placed under people. So some cards did overlap in terms of 
	what section they were sorted in. For the order of the titles I placed people a bit lower and put missions up higher. 
	Overall though my order wasn't vastly different from the site. </p>
